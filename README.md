# DisappointinglyAnnotated

This is a loose port of [DisapointinglyAttributed](https://github.com/aaronpowell/DisappointinglyAttributed) package to Java. Everything you need to know is written there.

Sadly, no table flipping, but instead a challenger appears! Russian flavored "Костыль",  which is translated as "Crutch" and in russian software developer slang means "awful solution, but works".

These annotations don't go to compiled classes, but are checked upon compilation.
